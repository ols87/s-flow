## Project Notes

This project was created to practice React, Tailwind, Sol web3.js, and the Streamflow SDK.

I am mainly an Angular developer who writes css by hand and has experience with EVM chains and ethers.js, so this was an interesting challenge that I enjoyed.

Parts of the project are over-engineered as a way to practice a different project architecture, and component-based approach.

I didn't use class-based components specifically because I have an Angular background and wanted to try something different.

The main stream creation can be found in `pages/payment`.

### Getting Started

npm run dev
